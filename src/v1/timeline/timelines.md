## Overview

A Timeline represents the duration, delay and easing of a specific movement of a layer.

For example, if a layer moves from left to right, the Timeline allows us to control how much time this movement will take (duration), if there is a delay, and the easing.

* Each layer can have its own `Timeline`.
* By moving and streching a `Timeline`, you can determine the delay and duration of a specific animation.

* To control the `delay` of an animation, drag the `Timeline` left or right.
* To control the `duration` of an animation, stretch or shrink the `Timeline`.
