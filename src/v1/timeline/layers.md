## Overview

* When entering Timeline, each layer in the Sketch group or artboard will convert into an image. 
* The format of the image can be `PNG`, `JPG` or `SVG`, as selected in Sketch's Exportable panel (or `PNG` by default).
* Layers can be moved around, resized, rotated, hidden or shown, in each `State` (except the `Initial State`).
