## Keyframes

* A Keyframe is a canvas which contains all the layers.
* All the layers that exists in the `Initial Keyframe`, will exists in all other `Keyframes`.
* You cannot add or remove layers between `Keyframes`, but you can show and hide layers.
* You can have as many `Keyframes` as you want, but to create an animation you need the `Initial Keyframe` and at least one more.

### The Initial Keyframe

* The `Initial Keyframe` is the starting point of the animation. That means all the layers are positioned as they are positioned in the Sketch document.
* You cannot change layers size or position or any other property in the `Initial Keyframe` since that where it all starts.
* To animate layers movement or resizing you must create another `Keyframe`.

### Keyframes Sidebar

* The `Keyframe Sidebar` is a list of all the `Keyframes`. 
* In each `Keyframe` you can view and select all the sub layers and groups of the `Keyframe`.
* All the `Keyframes` contain exactly the same layers.
* This is the same heirarchy as it exists in the Sketch document.
* In each `Keyframe` (except the `Initial Keyframe`) you can show/hide layers and change their properties, which will result in an animation.

## Layers

* When entering Timeline, each layer in the Sketch group or artboard will convert into an image. 
* The format of the image can be `PNG`, `JPG` or `SVG`, as selected in Sketch's Exportable panel (or `PNG` by default).
* Layers can be moved around, resized, rotated, hidden or shown, in each `Keyframe` (except the `Initial Keyframe`).
