Websites usually contain links to other webpages within the same website or external links to other websites.
`Launchpad` enables you to create both internal and external links.

There are 3 types of links:

1. `Page Link` - A `Link` between different `Artboards`
2. `Anchor Links` - A `Link` within the same `Artboard`
3. `External Links` - A `Link` to an external website

## Page Links

In Launchpad each `Artboard` represents a `Webpage`.
You can create links between different `Artboards` (`Webpages`).

1. Select the `Layer` which will trigger the navigation event. Usually this will be a button.
2. Click the `Link` button in the `Launchpad` panel.
3. Select the target `Artboard` (`Webpage`).

Many times you would want to create links to external websites that aren't a part of your website.
A great example are links to social media websites - Facebook, Twitter, etc..

To create an `External` link:

1. Select the `Layer` which will trigger the navigation event. Usually this will be a button.
2. Click the `Link` button in the `Launchpad` panel.
3. Click `External Link` at the top bar.
4. Enter the URL for the external website.

2. Click the highlighted `Link` button in the `Launchpad` panel.
3. Click `Remove Link`

## Home page

Every website needs a `Home` page. The `Home` page is the page that visitors will see first when they visit the site.  
To set the `Home` page for your website:

1. Select the `Artboard` (`Webpage`) that will be the `Home` page by clicking its name.
2. Click `Set as Home` at the top bar.
