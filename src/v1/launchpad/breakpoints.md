`Breakpoints` are a way to make your design look great on Mobile, Tables or Desktops.

To create `Breakpoints`, design your website in multiple `Artboards` where all the `Artboard` represent the same webpage but for different screen size.

For example, in the following screenshot you can see the same webpage in 3 different screen sizes.

To mark different `Artboards` as same webpage:

1. Select one `Artboard`
1. Click the `Breakpoints` button (marked in red below)
2. Drag yellow line to another `Artboard` that represents the same web page.
