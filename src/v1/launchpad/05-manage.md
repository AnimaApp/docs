### Launchpad Address

All websites on `Launchpad` are assigned with a unique id that looks like: `YimuYPD`.
Every *published* website is accessible via the `Web Address` [https://launchpad.animaapp.com/<site_id>]

If you want to make your free `Launchpad` web address prettier, you can choose your own `slug`.
> A slug is a user friendly and URL valid name of a webpage

*Slugs are unique across all websites hosted by `Launchpad`. That means you'll have to check that the `slug` you want is available before being able to claim it.*

### Custom Domains

You can assign your own custom domain to your `Launchpad` hosted website.
To do that click `Custom Domain`:

![]()

Enter your domain

![]()

Apply

Next thing you'll have to do is create a CNAME record that points your domain to `Launchpad`.

## Meta Tags

Meta Tags are a part of HTML. They enable providing information about the website that isn't actually presented for visitors, but is used by software that can read these tags and use their information.

* Search engines such as Google use `Meta Tags` to index the website in their database.
* Social media websites use specialized `Meta Tags` to enable previewing web pages within their feeds.

You can edit these tags to optimize the way your website is seen by Search Engines, Social Media websites, and more.
Better information such as an image and a clear description can increase the traffic to your website.

## Analytics

To track the traffic coming into your website you can sign up to any of the Analytics providers and paste in the code snippet they provide.

This piece of code will be embedded in each of the `Webpages` in your website and allow you to track traffic, usage, and much more.
