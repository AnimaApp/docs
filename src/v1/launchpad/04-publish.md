Publishing your website is a 2 steps process:

1. `Preview` - Create a preview website that only you know the link for.
2. `Publish` - Once you decide the website is ready, you can `Publish` it.

* Each `Preview` has its own `version` number, which is incrementing every time your create a `Preview`.
* You can create as many `Previews` as you want.
* You can always `Rollback` the live version to a previous `Preview`

## Preview

A `Preview` version allows you to see your website in a browser before publishing it and making it live to the world.

* Each `Preview` version is assigned with a preview url. i.e https://launchpad.animaapp.com/preview/i9VcUWl
* You can **share** this URL with **anyone** and they would be able to visit the preview website.

To create a `Preview` version:

1. Click the `Create Preview` button.
2. Leave the `Selected Artboards Only` checked or uncheck it if you want only the selected `Artboards` to be included.
3. Click `Create Preview`
4. Depending on the size of the images, fonts, and amount of `Artboards` this can take between a few seconds to about a minute.
5. Once ready, a dialog will popup and display the unique URL for the `Preview` website.
6. Click `Open` to visit the `Preview` website.

## Publish

You can publish your website by either:

1. Directly from the `Preview` ready dialog, clicking the `Publish` button.
2. From the `Manage` window clicking `Publish`.
3. Selecting a specific `Preview` version from the `Previews` window.

## Rollback

You can always go back and forward to any `Preview` version.
