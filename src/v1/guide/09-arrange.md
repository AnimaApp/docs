When changing `Artboard` sizes sometimes things can get messy. For example they sometimes overlap each other.  
That's why we added the `Arrange in Grid` button which not surprisingly all it does it to arrange the artboards in a grid.

**If you have layers lying around on the canvas, using the `Arrange in Grid` button might not be for you since it will change the artboards position.**
