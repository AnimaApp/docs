## What is Anima?

> A Modern Designer & Developer Collaboration Workflow

Anima's Workflow aims to solve major pains in the world of Designers & Developers collaboration.

- We provide tools that empower designers to express their designs to the finest details. 
- Then we automate the generation of source code for the design.
- Anima supports HTML/CSS code generation. iOS and Android are coming soon.

## The Anima Workflow

### The Designer

The Designer uses our Sketch plugin [Auto-Layout](/docs/v1/guide/) to create a responsive design.

### The Developer

The Developer uses our [Developer Dashboard](https://beta.animaapp.com/developer/dashboard/c/VR8gQhmSPmpuKM) to pick and choose components of the design of which to generate HTML/CSS for.
