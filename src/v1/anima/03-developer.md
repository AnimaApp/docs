## Developer Dashboard

- The `Developer Dashboard` enables developers to pick a single component in the design, and generate `.XIB` file.
- Generating a `.XIB` file will generate an Xcode project .zip file that contains all resources needed to present `.XIB` in a pixel perfect manner.
- Resources include Font files and Image assets.
- Developers can then drag and drop the pixel-perfect `.XIB` file to their project.
- The `.XIB` file is accompanied with its .h and .m source code file which contain only IBOutlet properties and no other code.


> `XIB` stands for the XML Interface Builder. `Interface Builder` is a part of Xcode and allows developers to use a GUI editor for building UI components.

## Sample Generated Xib

This XIB was generated by clicking `Generate .XIB` in the `Developer Dashboard`

## AnimaSDK

AnimaSDK is recommended to be included for the .XIB to display the design in a pixel-perfect manner. 

### Why?

Interface Builder doesn't support certain visual properties such as:

- Line Height
- Letter Spacing
- Paragraph Spacing
- Corner Radius
- Border Width
- Border Color
- Rotation

AnimaSDK uses [@IBDesignable](http://nshipster.com/ibinspectable-ibdesignable/) feature in Xcode to apply these values without the you having to write them in code.  

### Manual

You can opt-out of including AnimaSDK and just write the code manually to apply these visual properties.  
Simply don't drag it along with the .XIB.
