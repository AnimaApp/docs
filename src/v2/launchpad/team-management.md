## Creating a Team

1. Share your Sketch file using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) (or any file syncing software) with your team mates
2. Create a `Preview Website`
3. Create a `Team`: https://www.animaapp.com/dashboard/teams/create
4. Assign your team to your website in our web dashboard: https://www.animaapp.com/dashboard/websites/

All team members will now see the website under their Site Manager and be able to Publish the website with their changes.
