Widgets are embeddable HTML snippets that enhance our website funcationality.

## Level

Widgets can be added in 3 different levels:

* Layer
* Artboard (Webpage)
* Website

Setting a layer as a widget and pasting the HTML snippet means the HTML will render inside that layer.
Setting a widget on a webpage means the snippet will be embedded at the bottom of the <body> section.
Setting a widget on the website means the snippet will be embedded at the bottom of **each** webpage <body> section.

## How To

1. Select where you want to embed the widget, is it inside a specific layer or is it on the whole page or website.

2. click the ••• button -> Widgets

## In Sketch Rendering

When adding a widget that includes user interface, Launchpad will render it and place a snapshot in your Sketch design to make it easy to see how the widget blends in with the rest of the design.
