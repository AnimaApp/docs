* A `State` is a canvas which contains all the layers imported from Sketch.
* The `Initial State` can be imported from a Sketch `Artboard` or `Group`.
* All the layers that exists in the `Initial State`, will exists in all other `Keyframes` (but can be hidden).
* Layers cannot be added or removed from a `State`, but can be made hidden or visible.
* You can have as many `States` as you want, but to create an animation you need the `Initial State` and at least one more.

### The Initial State

* The `Initial State` is the starting point. That means all the layers are positioned as they are positioned in the Sketch document.
* You cannot change layers size or position or any other property in the `Initial State`.
* To animate layers movement or resizing, create another `State` and move layers around.

### States Left Sidebar

* The `States Sidebar` is a list of all the `States`. 
* In each `State` you can view and select all the sub layers and groups of the `State`.
* All the `States` contain exactly the same layers.
* The `State` has the same layer heirarchy as imported from the Sketch document.
* In each `State` (except the `Initial State`) you can show/hide layers and change their properties, which will result in an animation.
