# **Code Mode**

Collaborators can view the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React** code of the elements of the prototype and can download* the entire project as a code package containing all HTML, CSS, and assets in a zip file.

> **Requires a Pro plan*

1.  Open the prototype screen you want to comment on
2.  Select **Code mode** at the top bar of the Omni view
3.  **Select any element**  in the prototype  and the code will appear in the Elements panel. Use the Path bar on the code panel to navigate to the parent of the selected element
4.  Use the drop-down menu to switch between **HTML and React code**
5.  (Optional) Click the red **Download Code** button to export the entire project as a code package as seen below

## **Advanced Features**

**Code mode** has a few more great features for developers to stay in control:

-   **Assets –** Right side-bar contains all assets of the selected screen

-   **Overrides –**  Select any element and add CSS properties. The changes are applied  immediately,  just like on Chrome Inspect Too

- The difference between Anima Overrides and Chrome Inspect Tool is that overrides done in Anima are saved, and Chrome overrides disappear after refreshing the page.

-   **Compare**  – Allows you to match a snapshot of the original design that was synced from either Sketch, Figma or Adobe XD with the Anima’s results.
