When you create a team, you automatically get assigned as an **Owner**.

When others are invited to an Anima team, they can only be **Admins, Contributors, or Viewers**.

When others are invited to a specific Anima project, they are **Guests**.

 
# Members & Roles
![Members and roles cover](https://s3.amazonaws.com/animaapp/docs/web-app/Anima%204%20-%20Manage%20levels%20cover.png)
## **Owner**

-  There can only be one **owner** to a team: the creator of the team or if they transfer ownership to someone else
-  Can invite, edit, and delete the team
-  Can have a **Contributor** (paid seat) or **Viewer** (free seat) role

>**Owner Viewer**
>- This is suitable for a manager that wants to create a team but does not need to contribute to the design or code work and therefore doesn't need a paid seat.
>
>**Owner Contributor** 
>- They can manage the account and work on **Projects** alongside their team. They are most often department heads or team managers that run a design team.


 ## **Admin** 
 - Can do everything the **Owner** can except for deleting projects and team they belong
 - Requires a paid seat in **Basic** and **Pro** plans and has full access to the plan's features

## **Contributor** 
- Can invite members to join team and edit member's roles
- Requires a paid seat in **Basic** and **Pro** plans and has full access to the plan's features

 ## **Viewer** 
- Can only view and comment on any project inside the team
- Does not require a paid seat 
- Does not have access to paid plan features

>**Viewer Member Example**
> A designer wants to invite someone for feedback. This person will only need to run the prototype and leave comments but will view or export code. By inviting them as **Viewers**, no extra paid seats are needed

## Guests
The fourth type of member is **Guest**.

**Guests** are similar to **Viewers**, but the difference is that Guests can only have access to the project they were invited to and not the entire team the project belongs in.
