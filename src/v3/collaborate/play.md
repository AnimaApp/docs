![Omni view navigation bar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/animaapp/docs/web-app/Anima%204%20-%20Omni%20View%20top%20bar.png)

Anima converts your designs into real code-based prototypes, and after you sync them to an Anima project, it will appear in the **Omni** view.

Inside the **Omni** **view**, you can preview a prototype, leave feedback, view  HTML or React code, and invite others to collaborate.

This document will go over the three modes of **Omni** view: **Play**, **Comments**, and **Code.**

# **Play Mode**

In **Play** mode, you can interact with the code-based prototype and all its Anima features.

To see all the other screens in the project without leaving **Omni** view, click on the project’s name to expand the navigation menu.

# **Breakpoints View**

If breakpoints were added to the design using the Anima plugin, you can switch between devices using the **device icons** located in the top navigation bar of the Omni view.

Selecting the **Responsive** option will allow you to resize the screen and preview how the design would look on different screen widths.

Simply grab the blue slider on the right side of the Omni and resize the screen’s width.

>**TIP**
>To create a more fluid transition between screens, use Anima Breakpoints together with resizing constraints.

# Comments Mode

When viewing your prototype in the browser, use **Comments** to start a conversation about elements in the prototype.

You can also reply to other members’ comments or mark them as resolved.

1.  Open the screen you want to comment on
2.  In the **Omn**i view, select **Comments** from the top navigation bar
3.  **Select** the element you want to leave comments on
4.  **Type** your comment on the side panel
5.  Click the **Send** button or press **Enter**

# **Code Mode**

Collaborators can view the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React** code of the elements of the prototype and can download* the entire project as a code package containing all HTML, CSS, and assets in a zip file.

> **Requires a Pro plan*

![View HTML & React](https://s3.amazonaws.com/animaapp/docs/web-app/Anima%204%20-%20Code%20-%20HTML%20React.png)

1.  Open the prototype screen you want to comment on
2.  Select **Code mode** at the top bar of the Omni view
3.  **Select any element**  in the prototype  and the code will appear in the Elements panel. Use the Path bar on the code panel to navigate to the parent of the selected element
4.  Use the drop-down menu to switch between **HTML and React code**
5.  (Optional) Click the red **Download Code** button to export the entire project as a code package as seen below

## **Advanced Features**

**Code mode** has a few more great features for developers to stay in control:

-   **Assets –** Right side-bar contains all assets of the selected screen

-   **Overrides –**  Select any element and add CSS properties. The changes are applied  immediately,  just like on Chrome Inspect Too

- The difference between Anima Overrides and Chrome Inspect Tool is that overrides done in Anima are saved, and Chrome overrides disappear after refreshing the page.

-   **Compare**  – Allows you to match a snapshot of the original design that was synced from either Sketch, Figma or Adobe XD with the Anima’s results.

# **Share Project**

When the project is ready, click **Share** in the top right corner to invite guests to securely  collaborate or enable a Prototype link.

To share your project you can either:

1.  Invite guests or team members by email
2.  Share a prototype link


**Guests** are people outside of your team that can invite by email to specific projects. Guests require an Anima account.

If you want to share the prototype just a link to be viewed by others, you can use the prototype link which will present your prototype in full-screen. Anima account is not required.

## Advanced Settings

-   **Show Hotspots** – Adds hints on the clickable elements of your prototype when clicking on something that is NOT clickable. This helps those who are not familiar with the project to navigate through the prototype with ease.

1.  Click on **Share**
2.  Toggle Hotspots On/Off
3.  Re-sync your design using the Anima plugin in the design tool
4.  Run Prototype

-   **Show Restart button –** This option displays a button on the lower right corner of the prototype that takes you back to the starting screen.

-   **Password Protection –** Add another layer of protection for important content only meant for certain visitors.
