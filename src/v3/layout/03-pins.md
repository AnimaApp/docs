## Basic Pins 

![enter image description here](http://f.cl.ly/items/2W2n2j2H00331l1M2h2x/03%20Pins.png)

Basic pinning allows you to pin a layer to its parent with the following:

* Top
* Right
* Bottom
* Left
* Center Horizontally
* Center Vertically

When selecting a pin, **Layout** will set the pin constant value as the current pixel value.  

 - For example if a layer is 20px from the right and you select `Pin to Right`, the `right` pin constant value will be set to 20px

Once a pin is set, **Layout** will enforce the pin value when the artboard is resized.  

 - For example if you **pinned** a layer to the right by 20px, you can
   resize the artboard by dragging its right side and you'll notice the layer always stays 20px from the right

### Pin to Parent

* A `Layer` is always pinned to its `Parent`
* A parent can be either an `Artboard` or a `Group`
* Pinning between siblings can be achieved using `Stacks`
