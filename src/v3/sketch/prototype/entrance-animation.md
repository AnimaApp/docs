## How To :

 -  Select the component you want to animate on scroll
 -  In the **Prototype** tab, expand the **Smart Layers**, and click **Entrance Animation**  
 -  Pick a transition or enter your own custom CSS transition
 -  Check "_**Begin on scroll into screen**_" if it is not already checked in

**TIP:** 

 - Add **Delay** or make **Duration** longer if the animation happens too fast or even before you fully scroll past it
