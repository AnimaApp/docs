**Embedding Code** snippets will enhance your website functionality.


## Levels

**Embedded Code** can be added in 3 different levels:

**Layer**

 * Embedding a code snippet in a layer means the code will render inside that layer. 
 * **Example**: A Google map in your Contact page.
   

**Artboards**

 * Embedding a code snippet in a webpage means the snippet will be embedded in that specific page. 
 * **Example**: Embed a chatbot only in your Support page.
   
**Website**
  
 * Embedding a code snippet on the website means the snippet will be embedded in every webpage of the site. 
 * **Example**: Web tracking or analytic tools.
