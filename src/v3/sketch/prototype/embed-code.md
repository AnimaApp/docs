## Levels

**Embedded Code** can be added in 3 different levels:

**Layer**

 * Embedding a code snippet in a layer means the code will render inside that layer. *Example: A Google map in your Contact page.*
   

**Artboards**

 * Embedding a code snippet in a webpage means the snippet will be embedded in that specific page. *Example: Embed a chatbot only in your Support page. *
   
**Website**
  
 * Embedding a code snippet on the website means the snippet will be embedded in every webpage of the site. *Example:  Web tracking or analytic tools. *
