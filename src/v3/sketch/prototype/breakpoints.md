First, design your website in multiple artboards where each of the artboards represent the same webpage but for different screen size.

To mark different screen size artboard as the same webpage:

1. Select the artboard of one of the device screens, for example, **Home Desktop**
1. Expand the **Flow** section of **Prototype** and click the **Breakpoints** button (marked in red below) 
2. Drag the yellow line to another artboard that represents the same web page but in a different device screen, for example, **Table Desktop**, **Mobile Desktop**
