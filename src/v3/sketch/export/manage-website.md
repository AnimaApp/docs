![Manage Your Website](https://d1wuojemv4s7aw.cloudfront.net/items/462D3R0R3U3l2g2H1E3Q/%5Bb5f85499b18e632f772699380020010e%5D_Website+settings.gif)

## Custom Domains

Your website needs a place where your visitors can find it. With **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscriptions**, you will get a 'yoursite.animaapp.io' domain, but you  can assign your own custom domain to your **Anima** hosted website.

> If you do not have a custom domain, we recommend [Google Domains](https://domains.google) or [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).

There are 2 steps to do that:

1. Add your custom domain to your  **Website Settings** in **Projects**
2. Point your custom domain to our servers by creating a **CNAME** record in your domain provider settings

Follow the [this guide](https://docs.animaapp.com/v3/export/08-custom-domain.html) to add a Custom Domain.

### Meta Tags

**Meta Tags** are a part of HTML. They enable providing information about the website that isn't actually presented for visitors, but is used by software that can read these tags and use their information.

* Search engines such as Google use **Meta Tags** to index the website in their database

* Social media websites use specialized **Meta Tags** to enable previewing web pages within their feeds

* You can edit these **Meta Tags** to optimize the way your website is seen by Search Engines, Social Media websites, and more
