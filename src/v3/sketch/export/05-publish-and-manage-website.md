## Introduction

You have created a beautiful responsive and interactive **Website** or **High-Fidelity Prototype** in Sketch using **Anima** and now you want to publish it.

#### With Anima, you can publish your website in 3 easy steps:

 1. Create a Draft
 2. Sync Draft
 3. Publish Your Website

 You design in Sketch, and we take care of the rest:

-   Deployment
-   Hosting
-   Security
-   Availability

#### What you need

-   An **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscription** (Free Subscriptions display a "Powered by Anima" banner)
-   A **Custom Domain** (Optional)

## Publish Your Website

###  Step 1: Create a Draft

Once you have created your website, click **Preview in Browser** to verify that the website looks as desired. 

This will create a **Draft** of your design that only you can see.

**About Drafts**:

-   Each **Draft** has its own version number, for example _Draft v25_, which increments every time you create a **Preview in Browser**
-   You can create as many **Drafts** as you want
-   You can always roll-back the live version to a [previous Draft](https://docs.animaapp.com/v3/export/manage-website.html#Versions)
-   Only you can see and edit your **Drafts** until you **Sync** it

As shown in the chart above, **Sync** will make your **Draft** visible to everyone in your Team. Learn how to [Manage Access Levels](https://docs.animaapp.com/v3/export/manage-access.html).

### Step 2: Sync Draft

Once you are happy with how your site looks, you need to **Sync** your **Draft** to a **Project**.
 
Sync Via Draft Preview:

 - After you create a **Draft**, click **Sync** in the top right corner.
 
Sync Via Sketch:
 
 - There is not need to create a new draft, you can also go to the Anima Panel > Export > Sync > Select Project/Owner

### Step 3: Publish Your Website

Now that your website is **Sync'd**, you have two publishing options:
1.  Get a free Anima **Public Link** 
2. Or,  publish to your own **Custom Domain**:

**Get an Anima Public Link:**

1.  After you **Sync** your **Draft**, click **Share.** This will direct you to the **Team** options
2.  Enable and copy a **Public Link** to share with anyone

**Publish to Your Own Domain** (*Hosting or Pro Plans only)

> ❗️**Important**:  
>
> We are not a Custom Domain provider. You first need to get a domain from GoDaddy, Google Domains, or any domain provider.

1. Follow this [guide](https://docs.animaapp.com/v3/sketch/export/08-custom-domain.html) to create a **CNAME** record that points your domain to our servers
2. Next, go to your Website Settings and click **Add Domain**
3. Enter domain and click **Add**
4. In the top right corner of the Wesite Settings page, click on **Publish to www.yourdomain.com**
