4.  Click **Sync,** and then **Open**

**Step 2: Share**

>If developers do not need to edit designs, add them as **Viewers**, it’s free!

## What Developer Can Inspect in Specs

Now let’s take a look at how a Sketch design with Anima **Layout** features look in the **Specs** inspector.

The screenshot below shows that in Sketch, in the selected 'MenuButton' layer, the **Top** and **Right Pins** are selected.

The below screenshot of the **Specs** in the browser shows that selecting the same “MenuButton” layer in the browser reveals the **Layout specs** as well.

It also shows that the selected “MenuButton” layer is pinned to **Top** and **Right** by 20px.
