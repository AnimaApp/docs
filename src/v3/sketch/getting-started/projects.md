Projects are where your designs are live in Anima. There are two types of projects: **Personal Projects** and **Team Projects**.

-   **Personal Projects** are where you do work by yourself. Only you can access your Personal Projects unless you invite others as Guests (Share > Invite Guests). To access Personal Projects, click the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the Anima web app and select **Personal**.

-   **Team Projects** are where you can collaborate with others in your Organization. There can be multiple Projects in one team. Anyone added to the a Team can access these Projects. 
You can also invite Guests to a specific Project in a Team Projects and restrict them from accessing the other Projects (Share > Invite Guests).

> ❗️**Important:** 
> - Each **Team workspace** needs its own separate Anima subscription
> - **Personal workspace** will automatically be upgraded when a Team workspace is upgraded
