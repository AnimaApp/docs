## How Does It Work?

Designers can take their design to production in a matter of seconds.

Here are the steps for creating a prototype or website from a Sketch document:

1. Design your prototype or website in Sketch, where each screen is represented by an artboard
2. Make the design responsive by using **Layout**
3. Add **Links**, **Forms**, **Videos**, and any other Smart Layer feature
4. Create a preview to verify that the website looks as desired
5. Share it others and collaborate!
