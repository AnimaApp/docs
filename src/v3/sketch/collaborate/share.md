When the project is ready, click **Share** in the top right corner to invite guests to securely  collaborate or enable a Prototype link.

To share your project you can either:

1.  Invite guests or team members by email
2.  Share a prototype link


**Guests** are people outside of your team that can invite by email to specific projects. Guests require an Anima account.

If you want to share the prototype just a link to be viewed by others, you can use the prototype link which will present your prototype in full-screen. Anima account is not required.
