If breakpoints were added to the design using the Anima plugin, you can switch between devices using the **device icons** located in the top navigation bar of the Omni view.

Selecting the **Responsive** option will allow you to resize the screen and preview how the design would look on different screen widths.

Simply grab the blue slider on the right side of the Omni and resize the screenâ€™s width.
