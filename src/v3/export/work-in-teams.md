## Introduction

#### Anima Is a Collaboration Hub

Once you are happy with your design in Sketch and want to start collaborating with others, you need to sync your Sketch design to a **Project** that can later be added to a **Team** or just stay in your **Personal** workspace.

Anima allows you to share **Projects**, create **Teams**, assign different **Access Levels**, receive feedback as **Comments**, share **Specs**, and more, all in one place.

#### Guide Overview

In this guide, we are to learn to how to collaborate with others on a website or prototype.
  
Steps we will be taking throughout this guide:

1.  Creating a Project
2.  Sync Project to a Team
3.  Inviting Members to Join the Team
4.  Assigning Member Access Levels

#### Prerequisites:

-   A Sketch File
-   Anima Sketch [Plugin](https://www.animaapp.com/)

## Step 1: Create a Project

1.  Click **Preview in Browser** from the Anima Panel
2.  The first time you do this, you will see the choice to create a new **Project** or add it to an already existing **Project**
3.  Name the new **Project**
4.  Select an existing **Team** from the **Owner** drop-down list or create a new **Team** (_Step 2: Creating a Team)_
5.  Click _'Create'_

> ℹ️ **Tips:** Drafts
> 
> -   Each time you **"Preview in Browser"**, Anima creates a **Draft** of your work
> -   **Drafts** are only visible to you
> -   You can keep working on your **Draft** without affecting the live prototype until you **Sync** again
> -   **Personal** is a workspace for personal use.  Examples: **Projects** outside of work

## Step 2: Create a Team:

Now that you have a **Project,** we are going to add it to a **Team** where other **Members** can see it and collaborate.

There are two ways to create a new **Team:**

**1. Via Sketch:**

1.  Click **Preview in Browser** from the Anima panel
2.  Open the **Owner** drop-down list
3.  Select a **Team** or '_Create a New Team'_ if **Team** does not exist yet
4.  In the browser, name your new **Team** and  click _'Create Team'_
5.  Go back to Sketch and select the new created **Team** from the **Owner** drop-down list

**2. Via Projects**

1.  In your [Projects Dashboard](https://projects.animaapp.com), open the drop-down menu that says _'Personal'_
2.  Select _'Create new team'_
3.  Name **Team** and click _'Create Team'_

## Step 3: Add Members to Your Team

Ways you can invite **Members** to join your **Team**:

## Step 4: Sync Project to a Team

**_❗️Important:_** _Members will not see your design changes until you_ **_Sync_** _your_ **_Draft_** _with the rest of the Team._

In this step, we are going to **Sync** your design **Draft** so everyone you added to the **Team** can see your changes.

**Via Sketch**

-   Click **Sync** in the **Export** tab of the Anima panel

**Via Preview in Browser**

-   Click "**Sync**"  when you create a new **Preview in Browser**
