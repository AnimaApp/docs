### Custom Domains

Your website needs a place where your visitors can find it. With **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscriptions**, you will get a 'yoursite.animaapp.io' domain, but you  can assign your own custom domain to your **Anima** hosted website.

> If you do not have a custom domain, we recommend [Google
> Domains](https://domains.google) or [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).

There are 2 steps to do that:

1. Add your custom domain to your  **Website Settings** in **Projects**
2. Point your custom domain to our servers by creating a **CNAME** record in your domain provider settings

### Website Information

Optimize your website information to increase traffic to your site:

- Add a clear **Website Title** and **Description**

 -  A **Favicon** ( Website icon in the broswer tab) can make your site look professional
 
 - Add a **Cover Image** for a nicer preview of your website when you share it in social media posts
 
 - Add **Password Protection** for important content only meant for certain visitors

### Meta Tags

**Meta Tags** are a part of HTML. They enable providing information about the website that isn't actually presented for visitors, but is used by software that can read these tags and use their information.

* Search engines such as Google use **Meta Tags** to index the website in their database

* Social media websites use specialized **Meta Tags** to enable previewing web pages within their feeds

* You can edit these **Meta Tags** to optimize the way your website is seen by Search Engines, Social Media websites, and more
