Each team member is assigned with both a **Role** and an **Access Level:**  

The available **Roles** are:
-   Owner
-   Admin
-   Member

The available **Access Levels** are:

-   Contributor
-   Viewer

**Tip:**

-   **Contributors** can **Sync** design files to projects and require paid seats
-   **Viewers** on the other hand can only view and **comment** on **Projects**, and are _free_ of charge

**Examples**:

-   A person can be the **Owner** of a team with an **Access Level** of **Viewer.** This is suitable for a manager that wants to create a **Team** but does not need to contribute to the design work and therefore doesn't need a paid seat
- 
-   A designer wants to invite developers to view a prototype. The developers will only run the prototype but will not change it. By inviting the developers as **Viewers**, no extra paid seats are needed

# Access Levels

Besides you, there are two **Access Level** types are available for each person invited to a **Project** with Anima.

## Viewers

-   **Viewer** are free and unlimited. Each **Viewer** can view **Projects** and **comment**. They can also export files

## Contributors

-   **Contributor** are priced per person. They can edit designs, create prototypes, previews, and publish. Each **contributor** requires a paid seat

# Roles

Three types of **roles** are available to assign to each **Viewer** or **Contributor** that is part of an organization. One type of role can be assigned per seat.

## Owner

-   **Owners** are responsible for managing **Projects** and **Teams** in an organization

-   **Owners** can delete a project, manage approval for new **Contributor** seats, billing, integration, organization details, etc

An **Owner** can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Owner Viewers** often represent an organization as a member of management, finance, or IT. They help ensure your organization can smoothly update billing details or manage employee access at no additional cost

-   **Owner Contributors** are able to manage the account and work on **Projects** alongside the team. They are most often department heads or team managers that run a design team

## Admins

-   **Admins** can do everything the **Owner** can except for deleting **Projects**.

-   **Admins** are typically company employees who have access to **Team Projects** within an organization.

Admins can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Admin Viewers** are great for teams that collaborate across departments. Typically, **Admin Viewers** who join an organization are from engineering, product, support, or marketing teams where stakeholder input is needed on design work

-   **Admin Contributors** have access to all **Team Projects** within an organization and are able to edit and manage design work. Typically, these people are on the design team

## Members

-   **Members** have access to one or more **Projects** they’ve specifically been invited to.

-   **Members** do not automatically have access to all **Team Projects** within an organization. **Members** must be invited to specific **Team Projects.**

**Members** can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Member** **Viewers** are great for organizations that need to provide design visibility to stakeholders outside their company. Most often, **Members Viewers** are clients with access to a **Project** where they can comment, review, or export work
-   **Members Contributors** are able to access work in specific **Projects** they’ve been invited to. Typically, **Members Contributors** are contractors or clients who collaborate and contribute to design work
