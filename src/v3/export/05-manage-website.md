## Publish

## Address

All websites on created with **Anima** are assigned with a unique ID that looks like: `YimuYPD`.

Every *published* website is accessible via the Web Address: **https://***site_id***.animaapp.io**

If you want to make your free **Anima** web address prettier, you can choose your own **slug**.

> A **slug** is a user friendly and URL valid name of a webpage

**Slugs** are unique across all websites hosted by **Anima**. You'll have to check that the **slug** you want is available before being able to claim it.

## Custom Domains

You can assign your own custom domain to your **Anima** hosted website.

There are 2 steps to do that:

1. Add your domain to your **Projects** settings
2. Point your domain by creating a **CNAME** record in your domain provider settings
