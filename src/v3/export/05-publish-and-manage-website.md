## Introduction

You have created a beautiful responsive and interactive **Website** or **High-Fidelity Prototype** in Sketch using **Anima** and now you want to publish it.

#### With Anima, you can publish your website in two easy steps:

 1. Create a Draft
 2. Sync Draft

 You design in Sketch, and we take care of the rest:

-   Deployment
-   Hosting
-   Security
-   Availability

#### What you need

-   An **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscription**
-   A **Custom Domain** (Optional)

## Publish Your Website

###  Step 1: Create a Draft

Once you have created your website, click **Preview in Browser** to verify that the website looks as desired. 

This will create a **Draft** of your design that only *you* can see.

-   Each **Draft** has its own version number, for example _Draft v25_, which increments every time you create a **Preview in Browser**
-   You can create as many **Drafts** as you want
-   You can always Roll-back the live version to a previous Draft **(Coming Soon)**
-   Only you can see and edit your **Drafts** until you **Sync** it

As shown in the chart above, **Sync** will make your **Draft** visible to everyone in your Team.

### Step 2: Sync Draft

Once you are happy with how your site looks, you need to **Sync** your **Draft** to a **Project**.

**Sync** Via Sketch:
 
 - Click **Sync** in the **Export** tab of the **Anima** panel
 -  This will create a handoff link that you can share with your developers
 
Sync Via **Projects**:
 - Click **Sync** in the top right corner of your **Draft**
