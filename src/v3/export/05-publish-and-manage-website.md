## Introduction

You have created a beautiful responsive and interactive **Website** or **High-Fidelity Prototype** in Sketch using **Anima** and now you want to publish it.

#### With Anima, you can publish your website in two easy steps:

 1. Create a Draft
 2. Sync Draft

 You design in Sketch, and we take care of the rest:

-   Deployment
-   Hosting
-   Security
-   Availability

#### What you need

-   An **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscription**
-   A **Custom Domain** (Optional)

## Publish Your Webite

###  Step 1: Create a Draft

Once you have created your website, click **Preview in Browser** to verify that the website looks as desired. 

This will create a **Draft** of your design that only *you* can see.

-   Each **Draft** has its own version number, for example _Draft v25_, which increments every time you create a **Preview in Browser**
-   You can create as many **Drafts** as you want
-   You can always Roll-back the live version to a previous Draft **(Comin Soon)**
-   Only you can see and edit your **Drafts** until you **Sync** it

As shown in the chart above, **Sync** will make your **Draft** visible to everyone in your Team.

### Step 2: Sync Draft

Once you are happy with how your site looks, you need to **Sync** your **Draft** to a **Project**.

**Sync** Via Sketch:
 
 - Click **Sync** in the **Export** tab of the **Anima** panel
 -  This will create a handoff link that you can share with your developers
 
Sync Via **Projects**:
 - Click **Sync** in the top right corner of your **Draft**

## Optimize Your Website

### Custom Domains

Your website needs a place where your visitors can find it. With **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscriptions**, you will get a 'yoursite.animaapp.io' domain, but you  can assign your own custom domain to your **Anima** hosted website.

> If you do not have a custom domain, we recommend [Google
> Domains](https://domains.google) or [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).

There are 2 steps to do that:

1. Add your custom domain to your  **Website Settings** in **Projects**
2. Point your custom domain to our servers by creating a **CNAME** record in your domain provider settings

Follow the complete guide on adding **Custom Domains**. <<<**LINK TO CUSTOM DOMAINS**>>>

### Website Information

Optimize your website information to increase traffic to your site:

- Add a clear **Website Title** and **Description**

 -  A **Favicon** ( Website icon in the broswer tab) can make your site look professional
 
 - Add a **Cover Image** for a nicer preview of your website when you share it in social media posts
 
 - Add **Password Protection** for important content only meant for certain visitors

### Meta Tags

**Meta Tags** are a part of HTML. They enable providing information about the website that isn't actually presented for visitors, but is used by software that can read these tags and use their information.

* Search engines such as Google use **Meta Tags** to index the website in their database

* Social media websites use specialized **Meta Tags** to enable previewing web pages within their feeds

* You can edit these **Meta Tags** to optimize the way your website is seen by Search Engines, Social Media websites, and more
