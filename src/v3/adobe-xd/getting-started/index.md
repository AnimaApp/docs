## What Is Anima App?

**Anima App** enables designers to create real experiences, rather than clickable prototypes, and offers collaboration tools to build consensus across teams and organizations. Anima also converts Sketch and Adobe XD designs to HTML/CSS websites that can hosted on Anima servers or can be downloaded as a HTML/CSS code package and self-hosted. No coding needed!

 
**Anima App** is a great tool for:

 * High-Fidelity Prototypes ([Learn](https://medium.com/@AnimaApp/how-to-create-a-high-fidelity-prototype-with-adobe-xd-c54ea63c67de "Medium Article" ) how you can create one)
 * Websites based solely on HTML and CSS

**Anima App** does **not** currently support:

* Dynamic websites with Javascript

**Anima App** is great for:

 * Freelance designers
 * Design teams that collaborate with developers
 * Developers

## How Does It Work ?

Designers can upload a prototype and collaborate with a developer in a matter of seconds.

Here are the steps for creating a high-fidelity prototype from an Adobe XD document:

1. Design your website in **Adobe XD** where each screen is represented by an artboard
2. Add **Links**, **Forms & Text Inputs**, **Videos**, **Hover Effects**, and other Smart Layers
3. Create a **preview in the browser** to verify that the prototype looks and feels as desired
4. **Sync** to Project and collaborate
