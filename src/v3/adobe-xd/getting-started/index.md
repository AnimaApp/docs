## What Is Anima App?

**Anima App** enables designers to create real experiences, rather than clickable prototypes, and offers collaboration tools to build consensus across teams and organizations. Anima also converts Sketch and Adobe XD designs to HTML/CSS websites that can hosted on Anima servers or can be downloaded as a HTML/CSS code package and self-hosted. No coding needed!

 
**Anima App** is a great tool for:

 * High-Fidelity Prototypes ([Learn](https://medium.com/@AnimaApp/how-to-create-a-high-fidelity-prototype-with-adobe-xd-c54ea63c67de "Medium Article" ) how you can create one)
 * Landing Pages
 * Marketing websites
 * Static websites
 * Websites based solely on HTML and CSS

**Anima App** does **not** currently support:

* Dynamic websites with Javascript

**Anima App** is great for:

 * Freelance designers
 * Designers in start-up teams
 * Web Design agencies

## How Does It Work?

Designers can take their design to production in a matter of seconds.

Here are the steps for creating a website from an Adobe XD document:

1. Design your website in **Adobe XD** where each web page is represented by an artboard
2. Add **Links**, **Forms & Text Inputs**, **Videos**, **Hover Effects**, and other Smart Layers
3. Create a **preview in the browser** to verify that the website looks as desired
4. **Sync** to Project and publish!
