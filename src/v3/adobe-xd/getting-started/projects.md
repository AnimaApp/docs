Anima Projects live inside a Workspace or Team and there are two types of Workspaces: **Personal Workspace** and **Teams Workspaces:**

-   **Personal Workspace** is where you do work by yourself. Only you can access your Personal Projects unless you invite others as Guests (Share > Invite Guests). Use the sidebar to access your Personal Projects or click the drop-down menu in the top left corner of the Anima web app.

-   **Teams Workspaces** is where you can collaborate with others in your Organization. There can be multiple Projects in one team. Anyone added to the a Team can access these Projects. 

	You can also invite Guests to a specific Project in a Team and restrict them from accessing the other Projects (Share > Invite Guests). Learn more about **[Access Levels](/v3/adobe-xd/export/manage-access.html "Learn more about Anima Access Levels")**.

> ❗️**IMPORTANT** 
> - Each **Team Workspace** needs its own separate Anima subscription
> - **Personal Workspace** will automatically be upgraded when a Team workspace is upgraded
