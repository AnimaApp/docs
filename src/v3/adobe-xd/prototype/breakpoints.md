**Breakpoints** are a way to make your design look great on Mobile, Tables or Desktops.

For example, in the following screenshot you can see the same webpage in three different screen sizes:

## How to Create Breakpoints

First, design your website in multiple artboards where each of the artboards represents the same webpage but for different screen size, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**.


To mark different screen size artboard as the same webpage:

1. Click **Breakpoints** under the **Flow** section 
2. Holding **Shift**, select all artboards that you want to connect with breakpoints, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**
3. Click **Done** to apply the Breakpoints
