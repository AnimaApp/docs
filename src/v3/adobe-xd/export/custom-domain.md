You can use your own domain with a website created in Adobe XD using Anima.

There are 2 steps:

1.  Create a **CNAME** and an **'A'** record in your domain provider settings
2.  Add your custom domain to your Anima **Website Settings**

> ❗️**IMPORTANT** 
> We are not a Custom Domain provider. You first need to get a domain from GoDaddy, Google Domains, or any domain provider.


## 1. Create a CNAME Record

In your domain providers's settings, create a **CNAME** record that points your domain to our servers:

* Type: **CNAME**
* Host: **www**
* Points to: **ns1.animaapp.com**

Next, we are going to setup the "naked" domain which is your domain but without the '**www**'.

Create a new 'A' record:

* Type: **A**
* Host: **@**
* IP Address: **35.164.217.247**


Now, your websites should be accessible from:

1. http://yourdomain.com
2. http://www.yourdomain.com


>**❗️Important**:
>
>- To avoid any conflicts, your domain provider's settings should only have these two Anima records. Please delete any other existing records.
>
>- Domain changes can take between a few minutes to a few hours to take effect.

## 2. Add a Custom Domain

Next step is to add your domain to your **Projects** settings:

1. Go to your [**Projects**](projects.animaapp.com) dashboard
2. Click [**...**] on your website/project and select **Settings**
3. Go to the **Website** tab and click **Add Domain**
4. Add your domain twice, one with '**www.**' and without '**www.**
5. In the top right corner click on **Publish to www...**
