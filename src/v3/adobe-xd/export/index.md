Learn the difference between the three common Export actions:

1. **Preview in Browser** creates a private draft of your work that only you can see. This way you can you try and test different design ideas before sharing it with your Team.

2. **Sync** uploads your Private Draft to the selected Anima Workspace in our web app. Nothing will appear in the Anima Workspace if the Draft is not **Sync'd** to it. Also, if there are other members in this workspace, they will now be able to see and share your work.

3. **Code Export** will convert and save your design as a **Code Package** (.zip) that can be handed-off for development or hosted independently.
