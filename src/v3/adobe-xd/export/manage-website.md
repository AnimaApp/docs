## Custom Domains

Your website needs a place where your visitors can find it. With **Anima** **Hosting** or **Pro Subscriptions**, you will get a 'yoursite.animaapp.io' domain, but you  can assign your own custom domain to your **Anima** hosted website.

> If you do not have a custom domain, we recommend [Google Domains](https://domains.google) or [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).

There are 2 steps to do that:

1. Add your custom domain to your  **Website Settings** in **Projects**
2. Point your custom domain to our servers by creating a **CNAME** record in your domain provider settings

Follow the [this guide](/v3/adobe-xd/export/custom-domain.html) to add a Custom Domain.

## Website Information

 - Add a clear **Website Title** and **Description**

 - A **Favicon** ( Website icon in the browser tab) can make your site look professional
 
 - Add a **Cover Image** for a nicer preview of your website when you share it in social media posts

### Meta Tags

**Meta Tags** are a part of HTML. They enable providing information about the website that isn't actually presented for visitors, but is used by software that can read these tags and use their information.

* Search engines such as Google use **Meta Tags** to index the website in their database

* Social media websites use specialized **Meta Tags** to enable previewing web pages within their feeds

* You can edit these **Meta Tags** to optimize the way your website is seen by Search Engines, Social Media websites, and more

To track the traffic coming into your website you can sign up to any of the **Analytics** providers and paste in the code snippet they provide.

This piece of code will be embedded in the body of each of the webpages in your website and allow you to track traffic, usage, and much more.
