Anima converts your designs into real code-based prototypes, and after you sync them to an Anima project, it will appear in the **Omni** view.

Inside the **Omni** **view**, you can preview a prototype, leave feedback, view HTML or React code, and invite others to collaborate.

This document will go over the three modes of **Omni** view: **Play**, **Comments**, and **Code.**

## Play Mode

In **Play** mode, you can interact with the code-based prototype and all its Anima features in the browser.

To see all the other screens in the project without leaving **Omni** view, click on the projectâ€™s name to expand the navigation menu.
