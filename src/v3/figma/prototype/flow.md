## Links

In **Figma** each frame represents a webpage that can be connected to each other or other external websites via **Links**.

Anima supports **Figma's** native Click action to trigger the following actions:

- **Open Links** - A link to an external website
- **Overlay** - A link that displays a frame (webpage) over the existing one it was clicked from
- **Navigate to** - This is a simple action which takes you from one frame in a prototype to another.
- **Back** - This allows you to navigate back to the previous screen. 

Anima also includes:
- **Anchor Links** - A type of link that directs the user to a specific section of the same frame (webpage).

>❗️IMPORTANT
>- Figma Animation settings are not currently supported

## Anima Anchor Links

You can create **Links** to a different section in the same frame (webpage).

To create an **Anchor Link**:
1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **Anchor Link** from the Link Type drop-down menu
4. With your mouse, select the layer that will act as Anchor
5. Click **Done** to apply it

## Breakpoints

**Breakpoints** are a way to make your design look great on Mobile, Tables or Desktops.

For example, in the following screenshot you can see the same webpage in three different screen sizes:

## How to Create Breakpoints

First, design your website in multiple frames where each of the frames represents the same webpage but for different screen size, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**.


To mark different screen size frames as the same webpage:

1. Click **Breakpoints** under the **Flow** section of the Anima plugin panel
2. Holding **Shift**, select all frames that you want to connect with breakpoints, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**
3. Click **Done** to apply the Breakpoints

**Delete Breakpoints:**
1. Select any frames that has the breakpoint you want to edit
2. On the Anima panel, Click on the minus ( **–** ) icon next to the breakpoint you want to delete
