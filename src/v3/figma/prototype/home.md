Every website needs a Homepage. The Homepage is the page that visitors will see first when they visit the site.  

There are several ways to set the Homepage of your website or prototype:


* Select the starting frame, then click '+' in the Flow starting point section of the right sidebar.
* Select and right-click the starting frame, then click Add starting point.
* Add a connection between two frames with no existing connections or starting points.
* Duplicate a frame with an existing starting point.
