In **Figma** each frame represents a webpage that can be connected to each other or other external websites via **Links**.

Anima supports **Figma's** native Click action to trigger the following actions:

- **Open Links** - A link to an external website
- **Overlay** - A link that displays a frame (webpage) over the existing one it was clicked from
- **Navigate to** - This is a simple action which takes you from one frame in a prototype to another.
- **Back** - This allows you to navigate back to the previous screen. 

Anima also includes:
- **Anchor Links** - A type of link that directs the user to a specific section of the same frame (webpage).

>❗️IMPORTANT
>- Figma Animation settings are not currently supported

## Anima Anchor Links

You can create **Links** to a different section in the same frame (webpage).

To create an **Anchor Link**:
1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **Anchor Link** from the Link Type drop-down menu
4. With your mouse, select the layer that will act as Anchor
5. Click **Done** to apply it

>❗️IMPORTANT

## Edit or Remove Links

If you created an Anima **Link** and now you want to remove it:

1. Select the **Layer** with the link you want to remove
2. Click the **Trash Icon** in the **Link** section

Figma Links can be edited or deleted in Prototype mode.
