 "Supported Anima Links" )

In **Figma**, each frame represents a webpage that can be connected to each other or other external websites via **Links**.

Anima supports **Figma's** native Click action to trigger the following interactions:

- **Open Links** - A link to an external website
- **Overlay** - A link that displays a frame (screen) over the existing frame it was clicked from
- **Navigate to** - This is a simple action which takes you from one frame in a prototype to another.
- **Scroll to** – A link to a different section of the same frame
- **Open link** – A link to en external website. Make sure to include the full URL (http://....)

- **Back** - This allows you to navigate back to the previous screen. 
- **Smart Animate** - Smart Animate looks for matching layers, recognizes differences, and animates layers between frames in a prototype.
