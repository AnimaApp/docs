## Introduction\
\
You have created a beautiful responsive and interactive **Website** or **High-Fidelity Prototype** on Sketch, Adobe XD, or Figma using **Anima** and now you want to publish it.\
\
#### With Anima, you can publish your website in 3 easy steps:\
\
 1. Create a Draft\
 2. Sync Draft\
 3. Publish to a domain\
\
 You design using your favorite desing tool and we take care of the rest:\
\
-   Deployment\
-   Hosting\
-   Security\
-   Availability\
\
## Publish Your Website\
\
###  Step 1: Create a Draft\
\
A draft is a preview of your design that only you can see. This allows to see how the website looks and feels in the browser before you publish it.\
\
Start with a website designed in **Sketch**, **Adobe XD**, or **Figma** using Anima:\
\
1. Select an existing Anima Project and Team from the Project drop-down menu or create a new one (LINK)\
2. Select screens you wish to preview\
\'97If screens are not connected by links or Breakpoints, only the selected screens will upload\
\'97If screens are connected by Links or Breakpoints, selecting only one screen will automatically upload all other connected screens\
3. Click **Preview in Browser** in the Anima plugin panel\
\
> About Drafts Previews\
>\
> - Only you can see and edit your Drafts \
> - The design will not appear in your Anima Projects page until you **Sync** to it\
> - Each Draft has its own version number and you can always roll-back the live version to a previous Draft (Link)\
\
\
### Step 2: Sync Draft\
\
Once you are happy with how your private draft looks and feels and want to share it or start collaborating with others, you need to sync it to an Anima project.\
\
![Sync to Project](https://s3.amazonaws.com/animaapp/docs/sketch/Anima%204%20-%20%20Sync%20to%20Project.png)\
\
\
### Step 3: Publish Your Website\
\
Now that your website is **Synced**, you have two publishing options:\
1.  Get a free Anima **Prototype Link** \
2.  Publish to your own **Custom Domain**.\
\
**Get an Anima Public Link:**\
\
1.  After you **Sync** your **Draft**, click **Share**,\
2.  Enable and copy a **Public Link** to share with anyone\
![Enable Prototype link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/animaapp/docs/sketch/Anima%204%20-%20Enable%20Prototype%20Link.png)\
\
**Publish to Your Own Domain** (Pro Plans only)\
\
1. Go to your Project Settings and click **Add Domain**\
2. Enter your domainand click **Add**\
3. In the top right corner of Anima, click on **Publish to www.yourdomain.com**\
\
We are not a custom domain provider. You first need to get a domain from GoDaddy, Google Domains, or any domain provider.\
