Each team member is assigned with both a **Role** and an **Access Level:**  

The available **Roles** are:
-   Owner
-   Admin
-   Member

The available **Access Levels** are:

-   Contributor
-   Viewer

**Tip:**

-   **Contributors** can **Sync** design files to projects and require paid seats
-   **Viewers** on the other hand can only view and **comment** on **Projects**, and are _free_ of charge

**Examples**:

-   A person can be the **Owner** of a team with an **Access Level** of **Viewer.** This is suitable for a manager that wants to create a **Team** but does not need to contribute to the design work and therefore doesn't need a paid seat
-   A designer wants to invite developers to view a prototype. The developers will only run the prototype but will not change it. By inviting the developers as **Viewers**, no extra paid seats are needed


## Access Levels

Besides you, there are two **Access Level** types are available for each person invited to a **Project** with Anima.

### Viewers

-   **Viewer** are free and unlimited. Each **Viewer** can view **Projects** and **comment**. They can also export files

### Contributors

-   **Contributor** are priced per person. They can edit designs, create prototypes, previews, and publish. Each **contributor** requires a paid seat


## Roles

Three types of **roles** are available to assign to each **Viewer** or **Contributor** that is part of an organization. One type of role can be assigned per seat.

### Owner

-   **Owners** are responsible for managing **Projects** and **Teams** in an organization

-   **Owners** can delete a project, manage approval for new **Contributor** seats, billing, integration, organization details, etc

An **Owner** can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Owner Viewers** often represent an organization as a member of management, finance, or IT. They help ensure your organization can smoothly update billing details or manage employee access at no additional cost

-   **Owner Contributors** are able to manage the account and work on **Projects** alongside the team. They are most often department heads or team managers that run a design team

### Admins

-   **Admins** can do everything the **Owner** can except for deleting **Projects**.

-   **Admins** are typically company employees who have access to **Team Projects** within an organization.

Admins can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Admin Viewers** are great for teams that collaborate across departments. Typically, **Admin Viewers** who join an organization are from engineering, product, support, or marketing teams where stakeholder input is needed on design work

-   **Admin Contributors** have access to all **Team Projects** within an organization and are able to edit and manage design work. Typically, these people are on the design team

### Members

-   **Members** have access to one or more **Projects** they’ve specifically been invited to.

-   **Members** do not automatically have access to all **Team Projects** within an organization. **Members** must be invited to specific **Team Projects.**

**Members** can occupy a **Viewer** or a **Contributor** seat.

-   **Member** **Viewers** are great for organizations that need to provide design visibility to stakeholders outside their company. Most often, **Members Viewers** are clients with access to a **Project** where they can comment, review, or export work
-   **Members Contributors** are able to access work in specific **Projects** they’ve been invited to. Typically, **Members Contributors** are contractors or clients who collaborate and contribute to design work

## Invite Guests

The difference between a Guest and a Team Member is that Guests can only have access to the project they were invited to, and do not have access to the accounts settings.

Team Members, can see all projects inside the Team they belong to.
