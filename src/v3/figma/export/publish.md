## Introduction

You have created a beautiful responsive and interactive **Website** or **High-Fidelity Prototype** on Figma using **Anima** and now you want to publish it.


#### With Anima, you can publish your website in 3 easy steps:

 1. Create a Draft
 2. Sync Draft
 3. Publish Your Website

 You design in Adobe XD, and we take care of the rest:

-   Deployment
-   Hosting
-   Security
-   Availability

#### What you need

-   An **Anima Pro Subscription** (Free Subscriptions display a "Powered by Anima" banner)
-   A **Custom Domain** (Optional)

## Publish Your Website

###  Step 1: Create a Draft

Once you have created your website, click **Preview in Browser** to verify that the website looks as desired. 

This will create a **Draft** of your design that only you can see.  

To preview Anima's prototyping features:

1. Select existing Anima Project/Team from the dropdown menu or create a new Project/Team
2. Select frames you wish to preview
—If frames are not connected by links or Breakpoints, only the select frames will upload
—If frames are connected by Links or Breakpoints, selecting only one will automatically upload all connected frames
3. Click **Preview in Browser**. This will open a private draft of your Figma document in the browser.

> About Drafts Previews
>
> - Only you can see and edit your Drafts 
> - The design will not appear in your Anima Projects until you **Sync** to it
> - Each Draft has its own version number and you can always roll-back the live version to a previous Draft


### Step 2: Sync Draft

Once you are happy with how your private draft looks in the browser and want to share it or start collaborating with others, you need to sync it to a Project.

### Step 3: Publish Your Website

Now that your website is **Sync'd**, you have two publishing options:
1.  Get a free Anima **Public Link** 
2.  Publish to your own **Custom Domain**.

**Get an Anima Public Link:**

1.  After you **Sync** your **Draft**, click **Share**,
2.  Enable and copy a **Public Link** to share with anyone

**Publish to Your Own Domain** (Pro Plans only)


1. Follow this [guide](https://docs.animaapp.com/v3/sketch/export/08-custom-domain.html) to create a **CNAME** record that points your domain to our servers
2. Next, go to your Website Settings and click **Add Domain**
3. Enter domain and click **Add**
4. In the top right corner of the Website Settings page, click on **Publish to www.yourdomain.com**

> ❗️**Important**:  
>
> We are not a Custom Domain provider. You first need to get a domain from GoDaddy, Google Domains, or any domain provider.
