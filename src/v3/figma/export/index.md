Learn the difference between the three common Export actions:

1. **Preview in Browser** creates a private draft of your work that only you can see. This way you can try and test different design ideas before sharing it with your Team.

2. **Sync** uploads your Private Draft to the selected Anima project. If the preview Draft is not Synced to a project, nothing will appear inside the Anima project in the web app, and if there are other members in this Team, they will not be able to see your work.

3. **Code Export** will convert and save your design as a **Code Package** (.zip) that can be handed-off for development or hosted independently.
