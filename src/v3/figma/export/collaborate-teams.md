#### Anima Is a Collaboration Hub

Once you are happy with your design in Adobe XD and want to start collaborating with others, you need to **Sync** it to an **Anima Project**.

Anima allows you to share **Projects**, create **Teams**, assign different **Access Levels**, receive feedback as **Comments**, share **Specs**, and more, all in one place.

Let's start collaborating!
  
## Step 1: Create a Team:


1.  In your [Projects Dashboard](https://projects.animaapp.com), Click "Create new team" at the bottom of the Workspace sidebar
2.  Name the Team
3.  Click **Create**

## Step 2: Add Members to Your Team

1.  In **Projects**, select a your **Team's** name  from Workspace sidebar
2.  Click more options [**...**] in the top right corner and select **Team Settings**
3.  Go to the **Members** tab
4.  Click 'Add Members'

>**❗️IMPORTANT** 
>
> Members will not see your design changes until you **Sync** your **Draft** with the rest of the Team.

## Invite Guests

The difference between a Guest and a Team Member is that Guests can only have access to the project they were invited to, and do not have access to the accounts settings.

Team Members, can see all projects inside the Team they belong to.

2. Open it in the browser, and click **Sync** in the top right corner
4. Click **Share**
3. Enable and copy the **Public Link** to share with anyone
