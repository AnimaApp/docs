## What Is Anima App?

**Anima App** enables designers to create real experiences, rather than clickable prototypes, and offers collaboration tools to build consensus across teams and organizations. Anima also converts **Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD** designs to HTML/CSS websites that can hosted on Anima servers or can be downloaded as a HTML/CSS code package and self-hosted. No coding needed!

 
**Anima App** is a great tool for:

 * High-Fidelity Prototypes ([Learn](/v3/figma/getting-started/sample.html) how you can create one)
 * Landing Pages
 * Marketing websites
 * Static websites
 * Websites based solely on HTML and CSS

**Anima App** does **not** currently support:

* Dynamic websites with Javascript

**Anima App** is great for:

 * Freelance designers
 * Designers in startup teams
 * Web Design agencies

## How Does It Work?

Here are the steps for creating a prototype or a website from an Figma document:

1. Design your website in **Figma** where each web page is represented by a frame
2. Add **Links**, **Forms & Text Inputs**, **Videos**, **Hover Effects**, and other Smart Layers
3. Create a **preview in the browser** to verify that the website looks as desired
4. **Sync** to Project and publish!
