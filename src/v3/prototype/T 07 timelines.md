## Overview

A **Timeline** represents the duration, delay and easing of a specific movement of a layer.

For example, if a layer moves from left to right, **Timeline**  allows us to control how much time this movement will take (duration), if there is a delay, and the easing.

## Timeline Properties

* Each layer can have its own **Timeline** 
* By moving and stretching a **Timeline** , you can determine the delay and duration of a specific animation
* To control the  **delay** of an animation, drag the **Timeline**  left or right
* To control the **duration** of an animation, stretch or shrink the **Timeline**
