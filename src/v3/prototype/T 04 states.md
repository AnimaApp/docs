* A **State** is a canvas which contains all the layers imported from Sketch
* The **Initial State** can be imported from a Sketch **Symbol, Artboard,** or **Group**
* All the layers that exists in the **Initial State**, will exists in all other **Keyframes** (but can be hidden)
* Layers cannot be added or removed from a **State**, but can be made hidden or visible
* You can have as many **States** as you want, but to create an animation you need the **Initial State** and at least one more

### The Initial State

* The **Initial State** is the starting point. That means all the layers are positioned as they are positioned in the Sketch document
* You cannot change layers size or position or any other property in the **Initial State**
* To animate layers movement or resizing, create another **State** and move layers around

### States Left Sidebar

* The **States Sidebar** is a list of all the **States**. 
* In each **State** you can view and select all the sub layers and groups of the **State**.
* All the **States** contain exactly the same layers.
* The **State** has the same layer heirarchy as imported from the Sketch document.
* In each **State** (except the **Initial State**) you can show/hide layers and change their properties, which will result in an animation.
