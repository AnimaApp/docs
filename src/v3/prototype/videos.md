To embed a video to your website:

 3. Paste your video's URL
 4. Choose the Playback Settings: Auto Play, Loop, No Controls, Cover

To see it, click **Preview in Browser** in the Anima Panel.

## Files

If you want to embed locally stored files, go to your **Project Settings**, and in the **Files** tab, you can upload your videos/GIFs files from your computer and Anima will create a direct .mp4, .gif url that you can embed in the **Video/GIF** Smart Layer in Sketch.
