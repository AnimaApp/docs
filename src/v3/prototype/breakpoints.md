**Breakpoints** are a way to make your design look great on Mobile, Tables or Desktops.

To create **Breakpoints**, design your website in multiple artboards where all the artboards represent the same webpage but for different screen size.

For example, in the following screenshot you can see the same webpage in 3 different screen sizes:

## How To Create Breakpoints

To mark different screen size artboards as the same webpage:

1. Select the artboard of one of the device screens, for example, **Home Desktop**
1. Expand the **Flow** section of **Prototype** and click the **Breakpoints** button (marked in red below) 
2. Drag the yellow line to another artboard that represents the same web page but in a different device screen, for example, **Table Desktop**, **Mobile Desktop**
