 **Prototype** enables you to create both internal and external links between artboards (webpages).

There are 4 types of **Links**:

1. **Page Link** - A link between different artboard 
2. **Anchor Links** - A link within the same artboard 
3. **External Links** - A link to an external website
4. **Overlay Links** - A link that displays an artboard (webpage)  over the existing one it was clicked from
 
## Page Links

In **Prototype,** each artboard represents a webpage. You can create **Links** to connect different artboards  (webpages):

1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event (Usually this will be a button)
2. Click **Links**  in the **Flow** section of **Prototype**
3. Select the target artboard  (webpage)

## Anchor Links

You can create **Links** to a different section in the same artboard (webpage).

To create an **Anchor Link**:
1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event
2. Click **Links**  in the **Flow** section of **Prototype**
3. Select the target **Layer** in the Layers List  (webpage) 

❗️Note: This does not work with **Groups**, only **Layers** & **Symbols**

## External Links

Many times you want to create links to external websites that aren't a part of your website, for example,  links to Facebook, Twitter, App Stores, etc..

To create an **External Link**:

1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event. Usually this will be a text layer or a button
2.  Click **Links**  in the **Flow** section of **Prototype**
3. Point arrow and click **External Link** button at the top bar
4. Enter the URL for the external website or enter 'mailto: info@example.com' to link to an email address

## Removing Links

If you created a link and now you want to remove it:

1. Select the **Layer** with the link you want to remove
2. Click the **Trash Icon** in the **Links** section

## Homepage

Every website needs a Home page. The Homepage is the page that visitors will see first when they visit the site.  

To set the Homepage for your website:

 1. Select the artboard you want your **Prototype** or **Website** to start from
 2.  Click **"Set as Home"** in the  **Flow** section of the **Prototype** Panel.

## Overlays
An **Overlay** is a link type that lets you display another artboard on top of the existing one rather than as a separate destination screen.  

**Overlays** can be used for modal windows, drop-down menus, pop-up notifications, all without leaving your current screen.

Creating an **Overlay** is as easy as creating two links:

1.  Select the **Layer** that will trigger the **Overlay** 
2. With **Links** , connect it to the **Overlay** artboard
3.  Check the **Overlay** box in **Links**
4.  Now, select the **Overlay** component and link it to the "**Dismiss Overlay**" option at the top menu bar
5.  Change the **Overlay** artboard background color to transparent by moving the transparency slide to the left. Make sure that "*Include in export*" is checked in

> **ℹ️ Overlay Tips:**
>  - For a cooler **Overlay** effect, set its artboard background color to 70% Transparent
