## How Does It Work?

Designers can take their design to production in a matter of seconds.
Here are the steps for creating a website from a Sketch document:

1. Design your website in Sketch where each web page is represented by an artboard
2. Apply responsive design by using **Layout**
3. Optionally, add **Links**, **Forms** and **Videos**
4. Create a preview website to verify that the website looks as desired
5. Publish!
