## Overview

* When entering Timeline, each layer in the Sketch group or artboard will convert into an image
* The format of the image can be PNG, JPG or SVG, as selected in Sketch's Exportable panel (or PNG by default)
* Layers can be moved around, resized, rotated, hidden or shown, in each **State**(except the **Initial State**).
